# Pearson Trends Indicator

## Description
The Pearson Trends Indicator is a tool used to analyze the correlation between two currency pairs and identify market trends based on the calculated correlation coefficient. This indicator can be used in forex trading to determine the strength and direction of the relationship between currency pairs.

## Developer's Site
ForexRobotEasy.com is the developer's site for the Pearson Trends Indicator. For detailed reviews and trading results of this product, you can visit the [Forex Robot Easy website](https://forexroboteasy.com/forex-robot-review/pearson-trends-indicator-review-forex-software-analysis/). Please note that ForexRobotEasy is not the official developer of this product but provides sample code that can work as described in this product.

## Developer
The Pearson Trends Indicator was developed by the Forex Robot Easy Team.

## How It Works
The code provided calculates the correlation coefficient between two currency pairs using historical price data. The correlation coefficient is a measure of the strength and direction of the linear relationship between two variables.

The `calculateCorrelation` function takes in two arrays of price data for the currency pairs. It calculates the mean, covariance, and standard deviation for each currency pair. Then, it calculates the correlation coefficient by dividing the covariance by the product of the standard deviations.

The `identifyMarketTrends` function takes the correlation coefficient as input and determines if there is a significant market trend. If the correlation coefficient is above 0.8, it indicates a strong positive correlation and an uptrend. If the correlation coefficient is below -0.8, it indicates a strong negative correlation and a downtrend. Otherwise, there is no significant trend.

The `displayRelationship` function displays the strength and direction of the relationship between the currency pairs based on the correlation coefficient. It prints the corresponding message to the console.

The `OnChartEvent` function is the user-friendly interface that allows users to input currency pairs and view the trend analysis results. When the 'C' key is pressed, the function retrieves the historical price data for the specified currency pairs. It then calculates the correlation coefficient, identifies market trends, and displays the relationship between the currency pairs. If a significant trend is detected, it sends an alert to the user. This function can be further extended to track historical correlation data, implement risk management features, test the code, and integrate it into a software architecture.

Please note that this code is a simplified example and may require additional modifications and integration into a trading platform for practical use.

## Usage
To use the Pearson Trends Indicator, follow these steps:
1. Obtain the necessary historical price data for the desired currency pairs.
2. Modify the code to input the currency pairs in the `OnChartEvent` function.
3. Run the code in a compatible trading platform that supports MQL5.
4. Press the 'C' key to trigger the analysis.
5. View the trend analysis results, including the correlation coefficient and the relationship between the currency pairs.

## Compatibility and Deployment Considerations
- This code is written in MQL5 and is compatible with trading platforms that support MQL5.
- Ensure that the trading platform has access to the necessary historical price data for the currency pairs.
- Consider integrating this code into a larger trading system or strategy for comprehensive analysis and decision-making.
- Test the code thoroughly in a demo account or with simulated data before deploying it in live trading scenarios.
